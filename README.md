98 Cards game implemented in Python

About Game : 

98 Cards - A Single Player Card Game

The deck contains 98 cards numbered from 2 to 99.

Stack these cards on four different piles - one after another.

The two piles on top need to be in ascending order, the two piles at the bottom need to be in descending order.

To make it a little easier: if the difference between a card and a pile is exactly 10 you can put that card on that pile, the order doesn't matter. Use this rule to "shrink" your piles!

Now try to get rid of as many cards as possible!

Your score is equal to the number of cards you get rid of. 

Game is over when you cannot add any card to the pile.
